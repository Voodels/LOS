## Key Concepts Used

### 1. While Loop
- **Definition**: A loop that executes until a certain condition is met. In this script, the `while true; do ... done` creates an infinite loop, continuously prompting the user for input until they decide to exit.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  while true; do
    # Menu and operations
  done
  ```
  
### 2. Case Statement
- **Definition**: A control structure used to handle different menu choices from the user. Based on the user input, the script executes the corresponding block of code.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  case $choice in
    1)
      # Addition
      ;;
    2)
      # Subtraction
      ;;
    *)
      # Invalid input
      ;;
  esac
  ```

### 3. Arithmetic Operations
- **Integer Calculations**: In Bash, integer operations are performed using the `$(())` syntax. This allows operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and modulus with integers.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  result=$((a + b))
  ```

- **Floating-point Division**: Bash does not natively support floating-point arithmetic, so the `bc` command is used to perform calculations involving decimals. You can specify the precision (e.g., 2 decimal places) using the `scale` option in `bc`.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  result=$(echo "scale=2; $a / $b" | bc)
  ```

- **Modulus Operation**: The modulus operator (`%`) is used to calculate the remainder of a division operation.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  remainder=$((a % b))
  ```

### 4. Input Handling
- **Definition**: User input is captured using the `read` command in Bash. This allows the user to provide numbers or menu choices for the calculator.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  read -p "Enter first number: " a
  read -p "Enter second number: " b
  ```

- **Input Validation**: The script checks if the user input is valid, such as ensuring that numbers are entered correctly and handling invalid menu choices.

### 5. Error Handling
- **Division by Zero**: A condition is included to check if the user is trying to divide by zero, which would result in an error.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  if [ $b -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: Division by zero!"
  fi
  ```

- **Invalid Menu Choices**: The script validates the user's menu choice, ensuring that only valid options (1-5) are selected.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  if ! [[ "$choice" =~ ^[1-5]$ ]]; then
    echo "Invalid choice, please select a valid option."
  fi
  ```

### 6. Command Line Tools
- **Clear Screen**: The `clear` command is used to clean the terminal screen between operations to enhance the user interface.
  
  **Example**:
  ```bash
  clear
  ```

- **bc (Basic Calculator)**: The `bc` command-line utility is used for performing floating-point arithmetic. It allows the specification of the precision (`scale`), which is essential for performing operations like division with decimal values.

  **Example**:
  ```bash
  result=$(echo "scale=2; $a / $b" | bc)
  ```

## Usage

1. **Save the Script**:
   Save the script as `calculator.sh` to your preferred directory.

2. **Make it Executable**:
   Run the following command in the terminal to give the script execution permission:
   ```bash
   chmod +x calculator.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   You can now execute the script by running:
   ```bash
   ./calculator.sh
   ```

4. **Follow the Menu**:
   The script will display a menu where you can choose the operation you want to perform. After each operation, it will prompt you for the next one, and you can exit by selecting the exit option.

## Potential Interview Questions

### 1. **What is a shebang and why is it used in shell scripts?**
   - **Answer**: The shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) specifies the interpreter to be used when executing the script. It ensures the script runs with the correct shell, even if it is executed from a different environment or system with a different default shell.

### 2. **Explain how floating-point arithmetic is handled in a Bash script.**
   - **Answer**: Bash does not support floating-point arithmetic natively, so we use the `bc` command, which allows us to perform floating-point calculations with a specified precision using the `scale` option.

### 3. **How would you handle division by zero in a shell script?**
   - **Answer**: We can use an `if` statement to check if the denominator is zero before performing the division. If it's zero, we can display an error message to the user.

### 4. **What is the purpose of the `clear` command in this script?**
   - **Answer**: The `clear` command is used to clear the terminal screen between operations, creating a cleaner and more user-friendly interface for the script.

### 5. **How does the script validate user input?**
   - **Answer**: The script uses the `read` command to capture input and checks if the input is valid. It ensures that the user enters valid numbers for arithmetic operations and valid menu choices (1-5). Invalid inputs are handled by error messages.

### 6. **Explain the `case` statement and how it works in this script.**
   - **Answer**: The `case` statement is used to handle different menu choices. It matches the user's input (`$choice`) with the specified patterns and executes the corresponding block of code for each operation (like addition, subtraction, etc.).

### 7. **Why is the `bc` command used for floating-point operations?**
   - **Answer**: The `bc` command is a calculator utility in Unix-like systems that supports floating-point arithmetic. It is used in the script to handle division and other operations requiring decimal precision.

### 8. **How do you handle errors in Bash scripts?**
   - **Answer**: Errors are handled using conditional checks, such as verifying if a number is zero before performing division or checking if the menu choice is valid. Additionally, custom error messages are printed for invalid operations.
