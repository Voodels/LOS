# File Statistics using fstat System Call

This program demonstrates the use of the `fstat` system call to retrieve file information. Key differences from the `stat` version and important concepts:

## Key Differences from stat()
1. **File Access Method**:
   - `fstat` uses a file descriptor instead of a path
   - Requires opening the file first with `open()`
   - More efficient when you already have an open file descriptor

2. **Workflow**:
   - Open file → Get descriptor → Use `fstat` → Close descriptor
   - Better for checking status of already open files

3. **Security**:
   - Avoids race conditions between path resolution and file access
   - Works on already open files (useful for pipes/sockets)

## Important Concepts

1. **fstat() System Call**
   - `int fstat(int fd, struct stat *statbuf);`
   - Populates stat structure using file descriptor
   - Returns 0 on success, -1 on error

2. **File Descriptor Management**
   - `open()` returns file descriptor (int)
   - Always close descriptors with `close()`
   - Error handling for both open and fstat operations

3. **struct stat Contents**
   - Same structure as used by `stat()`
   - Contains all metadata about the file
   - Fields include:
     - st_mode: File type and permissions
     - st_size: File size in bytes
     - st_ino: Inode number
     - st_dev: Device ID

4. **Permission Bits**
   - User/Group/Other permissions
   - Read/Write/Execute flags
   - Represented as 3x3 rwx characters

## Program Flow
1. Open file with read-only access
2. Get file status using `fstat`
3. Close file descriptor immediately after use
4. Display information from stat structure
5. Handle errors at each step

## Compilation and Usage
```bash
gcc fstat_demo.c -o fstatdemo
./fstatdemo <filename>
