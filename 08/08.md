# Theory and Concepts Used in the `kill()` System Call Example

This document explains the key concepts and system calls used in the example program that demonstrates the `kill()` system call to send signals between unrelated processes.

---

## 1. `fork()` System Call

### **Function:**
The `fork()` system call is used to create a child process by duplicating the parent process. This results in two processes: the parent and the child, both running concurrently.

### **Return Values:**
- **Parent Process**: The return value is the **PID** (Process ID) of the child process.
- **Child Process**: The return value is `0`.

### **Usage:**
- The `fork()` system call creates a child process, and the execution flow in both the parent and child processes diverges.

## 2. `kill()` System Call

### **Function:**
The `kill()` system call is used to send a signal to a process, either by using its **PID** (process ID) or by specifying a special signal like `SIGUSR1`. It allows communication between processes by signaling them to perform certain actions.

### **Syntax:**
```c
int kill(pid_t pid, int sig);
pid: The process ID of the target process (or -1 to send the signal to all processes in the same process group).

sig: The signal to send (for example, SIGUSR1, SIGKILL, SIGTERM).

Common Signals:
SIGUSR1: User-defined signal, typically used for custom inter-process communication.

SIGKILL: Forcefully terminates a process (cannot be caught).

SIGTERM: Gracefully terminates a process.

Usage:
In this example, kill() sends the SIGUSR1 signal to the child process, which is an unrelated process. This allows the parent process to communicate with the child.

3. signal() System Call
Function:
The signal() system call is used to set up a signal handler, which defines how a process should handle a particular signal.

Syntax:
c

Edit
void (*signal(int sig, void (*func)(int)))(int);
sig: The signal number (e.g., SIGUSR1).

func: The function that will handle the signal.

Usage:
In the example, signal(SIGUSR1, handle_signal) is used to set up a handler function (handle_signal) that gets executed when the SIGUSR1 signal is received by the child process.

4. pause() System Call
Function:
The pause() system call is used to make the calling process sleep until it receives a signal. It is commonly used in scenarios where a process is waiting for a signal to arrive.

Usage:
In the example, the child process calls pause() to wait for the SIGUSR1 signal. When the signal arrives, the signal handler (handle_signal) is executed.

Key Concepts of Process Communication
Signal Handling:
Signals are a form of inter-process communication (IPC) used to notify processes about certain events or requests for action. In this example, signals are used to communicate between the parent and child processes.

Parent-Child Process Relationship:
In this program, the parent process sends a signal (SIGUSR1) to the child process. The child process is waiting for the signal using pause(). Upon receiving the signal, the child process executes the signal handler function (handle_signal).

Key Takeaways
fork(): Creates a child process, allowing parent and child processes to run concurrently.

kill(): Sends a signal to a process, enabling communication between processes.

signal(): Sets up a signal handler for a specific signal to define how the process should respond.

pause(): Causes a process to sleep until it receives a signal.

This example demonstrates how signals can be used to communicate between unrelated processes, allowing them to synchronize or respond to events, making inter-process communication possible in Unix-like operating systems.
