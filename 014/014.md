# 🖥️ Chat Application - Server and Client Architecture (Java)

## 📡 Server Architecture

- **ServerSocket** is used to listen for incoming client connections.
- Maintains a **thread-safe set** of connected clients (`ClientHandler` instances).
- **Creates a new thread** for each client connection to handle communication independently.

---

## 🧑‍💻 ClientHandler (Server-side Component)

- **Manages** individual client connections.
- **Receives messages** from a client and **broadcasts** them to all other connected clients.
- **Input:** Uses `BufferedReader` to read messages from the client.
- **Output:** Uses `PrintWriter` to send messages back to the client.
- **Disconnect Handling:** 
  - If a client disconnects, it **removes** itself from the server’s `clientHandlers` set.
  - Closes the client socket gracefully.

---

## 👨‍💻 Client Implementation

- **Connects** to the server using a `Socket`.
- Uses a **separate thread** to **continuously receive messages** from the server.
- **Main thread**:
  - Handles **user input** from the terminal.
  - Sends messages to the server.
- Supports an **"exit" command**:
  - If the user types `"exit"`, the client socket **closes** and the user **leaves the chat**.

# ⚡ Overall Workflow

| Step | Description |
|:----:|:------------|
| 1 | Server starts and waits for client connections. |
| 2 | Client connects, server accepts and assigns a `ClientHandler` thread. |
| 3 | Client enters username and starts chatting. |
| 4 | Messages sent by a client are broadcasted to others by the server. |
| 5 | Client can type `"exit"` to leave, and server removes the client from the list. |
