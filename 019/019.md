# Digital Clock Implementation

## Key Features
- Updates time every second
- Displays in HH:MM:SS format
- Clean exit with Ctrl+C
- Hidden cursor during operation

## Key Components
1. `tput civis/cnorm`
   - `civis`: Hides terminal cursor
   - `cnorm`: Restores cursor visibility

2. `trap` Command
   - Handles SIGINT (Ctrl+C) signal
   - Ensures cursor visibility is restored
   - Syntax: `trap 'commands' SIGNAL`

3. Infinite Loop
   - `while true` creates continuous loop
   - `sleep 1` pauses for 1 second

4. Date Formatting
   - `date +%T` shows time in 24-hour format
   - `printf "\r"` returns cursor to line start

## Usage
```bash
chmod +x digital_clock.sh
./digital_clock.sh



Here's the documentation in Markdown format for your shell script that displays the current time in HH:MM:SS format continuously:

# Shell Script: Display Current Time Continuously

## Features
1. **Continuous Time Display**:
   - Displays the current time in HH:MM:SS format.
   - Updates the time every second.

2. **User Interface**:
   - The cursor is hidden while the script is running to improve visual output.
   - The cursor is restored when the script is interrupted (Ctrl+C).
   
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensures proper cleanup when the script is interrupted by restoring the cursor.

## Key Concepts Used

### 1. **`tput` Command**
   - **`tput civis`**: Hides the cursor.
   - **`tput cnorm`**: Restores the cursor when the script exits or when interrupted.

### 2. **`trap` Command**
   - **`trap 'tput cnorm; exit' SIGINT`**: This command captures the `SIGINT` signal (generated by pressing `Ctrl+C`) and restores the cursor before exiting the script.
   
### 3. **`while true` Loop**
   - **Continuous Loop**: The `while true; do ... done` loop runs indefinitely, updating the time display every second.

### 4. **`printf` Command**
   - **`printf "\r%s" "$(date +%T)"`**: This prints the current time in HH:MM:SS format. The `\r` ensures the cursor moves to the beginning of the line, so the time is updated in place without printing new lines.
   
### 5. **`date` Command**
   - **`$(date +%T)`**: The `date` command is used to fetch the current time in the format HH:MM:SS.

### 6. **`sleep` Command**
   - **`sleep 1`**: Pauses the script for one second before updating the time.

## Usage

1. Save the script as `current_time.sh`.
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x current_time.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./current_time.sh
   ```

4. The script will display the current time continuously in HH:MM:SS format, updating every second. To stop it, press `Ctrl+C` to exit.

## Possible Interview Questions

### 1. **What does the `trap` command do in this script?**
   - **Answer**: The `trap` command is used to capture signals, such as `SIGINT` (triggered by pressing `Ctrl+C`). In this script, it ensures the cursor is restored to its normal state before exiting when the user interrupts the script.

### 2. **What is the purpose of `tput civis` and `tput cnorm` in this script?**
   - **Answer**: `tput civis` hides the cursor to improve the user experience while the script runs. `tput cnorm` restores the cursor when the script exits, ensuring that the terminal behaves normally after the script completes.

### 3. **Why is a `while true` loop used in this script?**
   - **Answer**: The `while true` loop is used to keep the script running indefinitely, updating the displayed time every second. It ensures the time keeps refreshing until the user interrupts the script.

### 4. **How does `printf` work with `\r` in this script?**
   - **Answer**: The `\r` (carriage return) in `printf` moves the cursor back to the beginning of the line, allowing the time to be overwritten every second, so it appears that the time is continuously updating in place.

### 5. **What would happen if you removed the `sleep 1` command?**
   - **Answer**: If the `sleep 1` command were removed, the script would update the time as fast as possible, which could lead to a very high CPU usage. The `sleep 1` command ensures the script only updates once every second, giving the system a break between updates.

## Example Output

```
12:30:45
12:30:46
12:30:47
...
```

### Conclusion
This script continuously displays the current time in a clean and efficient manner. It demonstrates the use of `while` loops, `trap` commands, and terminal output manipulation. It's a simple but effective way to keep track of time or implement other periodic tasks in a shell script.
