# Inter-Process Communication Using Signals

This program demonstrates inter-process communication between parent and child processes using signals and the following system calls:

## Key Concepts

1. **fork()**
   - Creates a child process that is an exact copy of the parent
   - Returns 0 to the child process and the child's PID to the parent

2. **kill()**
   - System call to send a signal to a process
   - Syntax: `kill(pid, signal)`
   - Used here to send SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2 between processes

3. **signal()**
   - Registers a handler function for specific signals
   - SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are user-defined signals
   - Avoid using unsafe functions in handlers

4. **pause()**
   - Suspends execution until a signal is received
   - Used to wait for signals in both processes

5. **volatile sig_atomic_t**
   - Special type for variables accessed in signal handlers
   - Ensures safe access across asynchronous signal handling

## Program Flow

1. Parent sets up a signal handler for SIGUSR2
2. Parent creates a child process using `fork()`
3. Child process:
   - Registers handler for SIGUSR1
   - Enters wait loop using `pause()`
4. Parent process:
   - Waits 1 second to ensure child is ready
   - Sends SIGUSR1 to child using `kill()`
5. Child's signal handler:
   - Receives SIGUSR1
   - Sends SIGUSR2 back to parent
   - Sets exit flag
6. Parent's signal handler:
   - Receives SIGUSR2
   - Continues execution to clean up child process

## Compilation and Execution

Compile with:
```bash
gcc signal_kill_demo.c -o signal_demo



# Cross-Language Signal Demonstration

## C++ Version
- Uses traditional UNIX process model
- Key elements:
  - `fork()` creates child process
  - `kill()` sends signals
  - `signal()` registers handlers
  - `pause()` waits for signals
- Direct equivalent of C version using C++ I/O

## Java Version
- Uses ProcessBuilder for child processes
- Important notes:
  - Relies on non-portable `sun.misc` classes
  - Signal handling only works on UNIX systems
  - Parent parses child's PID from output
  - Uses `kill` command via Runtime.exec()
- Limitations:
  - Not production-safe
  - Platform-dependent
  - Requires Java 9+ for ProcessHandle

## Go Version
- Uses native concurrency features
- Implementation details:
  - `exec.Command` creates child process
  - `Process.Signal()` sends signals
  - `signal.Notify()` handles signals
  - Channels coordinate execution
- Advantages:
  - More modern approach
  - Built-in signal handling
  - Clean process management

## Common Concepts
1. **Process Creation**
   - C++/Go: Direct process forking
   - Java: External process creation

2. **Signal Handling**
   - All: Custom handlers for user signals
   - Different registration mechanisms

3. **IPC Coordination**
   - Parent-child synchronization
   - Signal-based communication

## Execution Notes
- C++/Go: Direct compilation and execution
- Java: Requires special JVM arguments:
  ```bash
  java --add-opens=jdk.management/sun.management=ALL-UNNAMED SignalDemo
