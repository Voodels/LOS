# Demonstration of `wait()` with `fork()`

This program demonstrates how the `wait()` system call is used alongside `fork()` to synchronize parent and child processes.

## Explanation

### Logic

1. **Parent process** creates a **child process** using `fork()`.
2. If `fork()` returns `0`, it indicates we are inside the **child process**:
   - The child performs its work (here, it simply prints messages and sleeps for a few seconds to simulate work).
   - After completing its work, the child process exits.
3. If `fork()` returns a positive number (`>0`), it indicates we are inside the **parent process**:
   - The parent calls `wait()` to block its execution **until the child process terminates**.
   - Once the child exits, the parent resumes and prints a completion message.

## Key Concepts

### 1. `fork()` System Call
- `fork()` creates a new child process that is a duplicate of the parent.
- `fork()` returns:
  - `0` to the child process,
  - Child's Process ID (PID) to the parent,
  - `-1` on failure.

### 2. `wait()` System Call
- `wait()` makes the parent **pause** execution until one of its child processes exits.
- It helps **synchronize** the parent and child, ensuring the parent does not continue before the child has finished its task.
- Prevents **zombie processes** by allowing the parent to "collect" the child's exit status.

### 3. Zombie Processes
- A **zombie** process is a child process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table.
- Using `wait()` properly **avoids zombies** by cleaning up the childâ€™s resources.

## Important Notes

- Always check the return value of `fork()` for robust programs.
- Using `wait()` is essential in real-world applications where parent and child processes need to coordinate.
- `sleep()` is used here to simulate a time delay or work done by the child process.

## Summary Table

| Concept | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `fork()` | Creates a child process |
| `wait()` | Parent waits for the child process to terminate |
| Synchronization | Parent is blocked until the child finishes |
| Zombie Prevention | Ensured by properly calling `wait()` |
