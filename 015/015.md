Of course! Here's your **well-organized `.md` (Markdown)** notes for **Logic and Concept** of the *"Three threads printing Even, Odd, and Prime numbers"* program:

# 🧵 Multithreading Program Concept Notes

## 🎯 Objective

Create **three threads** in C:
- **Thread 1**: Prints **Even Numbers**.
- **Thread 2**: Prints **Odd Numbers**.
- **Thread 3**: Prints **Prime Numbers**.

Each thread runs **independently** and prints its assigned type of numbers.

---

## 🏗️ Key Components

### 1. Threads
- **Threads** allow multiple tasks to run "independently" within the same program.
- We use **POSIX Threads** (`pthread` library) in C.
- Threads share the same memory space, making communication easy but synchronization necessary (not a major concern here as we're only printing).

---

### 2. pthread Functions Used
| Function | Purpose |
|:--------|:---------|
| `pthread_create()` | Create a new thread. |
| `pthread_join()` | Wait for a thread to finish execution. |
| `pthread_exit()` | Terminate a thread manually. |

---

### 3. Helper Functions

- `isPrime(int n)`: Checks if a number is **prime**.
  - A number is prime if it is greater than 1 and divisible only by 1 and itself.
  - Optimization: Only check divisibility up to √n.

---

### 4. Program Flow

1. **Create three threads**:
    - Thread 1 → calls `printEven()`
    - Thread 2 → calls `printOdd()`
    - Thread 3 → calls `printPrime()`
  
2. **Each thread prints numbers**:
    - `printEven()`: Prints even numbers from 1 to 20.
    - `printOdd()`: Prints odd numbers from 1 to 20.
    - `printPrime()`: Prints prime numbers from 1 to 50.

3. **Main thread** waits for all threads to complete using `pthread_join()`.

4. **Exit** when all threads complete execution.

---

## ⚙️ How it Works Internally

- When the program starts, `main()` creates 3 separate threads.
- Each thread runs its assigned function **concurrently** (order of printing may vary due to thread scheduling).
- The CPU manages the threads, giving time slices to each.
- `pthread_join()` ensures that the main program **waits** until all threads are done.

---

## 🛠️ Important Points

- Threads **may print output interleaved**, depending on how CPU schedules them.
- No synchronization (mutexes/locks) needed here because **just reading and printing** (no shared variable modification).
- Thread execution is **independent**.
- Use `-lpthread` flag during compilation to link pthreads.

## 🧠 Summary

| Topic | Details |
|:-----|:--------|
| Multithreading | Create multiple flows of execution within the same program. |
| Threads | Light-weight processes, share memory. |
| Pthread | POSIX standard for threading in C. |
| Why Threads? | Parallel work (Even, Odd, Prime printed together). |

---

# 📜 Compilation and Execution

```bash
gcc filename.c -lpthread
./a.out
```

- `-lpthread` links pthread library.
- `./a.out` runs the compiled program.

    A[main()] --> B[pthread_create() Thread1 -> printEven()]
    A --> C[pthread_create() Thread2 -> printOdd()]
    A --> D[pthread_create() Thread3 -> printPrime()]
    B --> E[pthread_join(Thread1)]
    C --> F[pthread_join(Thread2)]
    D --> G[pthread_join(Thread3)]
    E & F & G --> H[Program Ends]
```

# 🚀 Bonus Tip

If you want cleaner ordered outputs (not mixed printing), you would need **thread synchronization techniques** like **mutexes** or **semaphores**, but they are **not necessary** here.

Would you like me to also give you a **folder structure** (like `/src`, `/build`) if you're planning to organize this for submission or practice? 🎯  
(If yes, I can generate that too!)
