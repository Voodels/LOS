# Fork System Call Example

This program demonstrates how to create **five child processes** using the `fork` system call, where each child performs a different arithmetic operation.

---

## How to Run

### C
```bash
gcc fork_operations.c -o fork_operations
./fork_operations
```

### C++
```bash
g++ fork_operations.cpp -o fork_operations
./fork_operations
```

### Java
```bash
javac ForkOperations.java
java ForkOperations
```

### Go
```bash
go build fork_operations.go
./fork_operations
```

## Explanation

### Logic
- The **parent process** loops **5 times**, calling `fork()` in each iteration.
- On each successful `fork()`, a **new child process** is created.
- Each child process performs a unique arithmetic operation depending on the **loop index** (`0` to `4`).
- The parent uses `wait()` (in C/C++) or `Wait4` (in Go) to wait for all its child processes to complete.

### Key Concepts Used

#### 1. Fork System Call
- `fork()` creates a **new child process** that is a **copy** of the parent process.
- In the parent, `fork()` returns the **child's PID (Process ID)**.
- In the child, `fork()` returns **0**.

#### 2. Process ID (PID)
- Used to distinguish between **parent** and **child** processes.
- Parent can manage (wait, kill) its children using their PIDs.

#### 3. Concurrency
- Each child process runs **independently and concurrently**.
- Outputs from different child processes can **appear in any order**.

#### 4. Zombie Process Prevention
- After a child process finishes execution, it becomes a **zombie** until the parent reads its exit status.
- The **parent** uses `wait()` or `waitpid()` to properly **reap** child processes and avoid zombies.

#### 5. Special Notes
- **Java** does not directly support `fork()`. It simulates the behavior using **threads** or **ProcessBuilder**.
- **Go** does not have a direct `fork()` either. Instead, it uses `syscall.ForkExec()` or creates new goroutines and processes if needed.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Output order is not guaranteed** because child processes execute asynchronously.
- Always **check the return value** of `fork()` to determine whether you're in the **parent** or **child** process.
- Always **wait for child processes** in the parent to ensure clean process management.

| Java     | Threads / ProcessBuilder | `Thread.join()` or Process APIs |
| Go       | `ForkExec` (manual) or goroutines | `Wait4` or `os.Process.Wait()` |
