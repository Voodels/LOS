# Demonstrating `exit()` System Call with `fork()` and `wait()`

This program demonstrates the use of the `exit()` system call in a child process, along with `fork()` to create the child and `wait()` in the parent process to wait for the child process to terminate.

---

## Code Explanation

### Program Overview

1. The program first creates a child process using the `fork()` system call.
2. The child process then calls the `exit()` system call to terminate.
3. The parent process waits for the child process to terminate using the `wait()` system call.

---

### 1. `fork()` System Call

- **Function**: The `fork()` system call creates a new child process that is a copy of the parent process. 
- **Return Value**: 
  - In the parent process, `fork()` returns the process ID (PID) of the child process.
  - In the child process, `fork()` returns `0`.

---

### 2. `exit()` System Call

- **Function**: The `exit()` system call is used to terminate the calling process. It can be used in the child process to terminate after performing its task.
- **Exit Status**: The status passed to `exit()` can be retrieved by the parent process when it waits for the child using `wait()`. A value of `0` indicates successful termination, and any non-zero value indicates an error.

```c
exit(0);  // Child process terminates with status 0
```

---

### 3. `wait()` System Call

- **Function**: The `wait()` system call makes the parent process wait until the child process terminates. It allows the parent to retrieve the exit status of the child process.
- **Usage**: In this program, the parent waits for the child process to finish before proceeding.

```c
wait(&status);  // Parent waits for the child to terminate
```

---

## Code Walkthrough

### 1. Forking a Child Process

```c
pid = fork();  // Create a child process
```

- If `pid == 0`, we are in the child process.
- If `pid > 0`, we are in the parent process.

### 2. Child Process Terminates with `exit()`

```c
if (pid == 0) {
    // Child process
    printf("Child Process: I will now exit.\n");
    exit(0);  // Child process exits with status 0
}
```

- The child process prints a message and then terminates using `exit(0)`.

### 3. Parent Process Waits for Child Process

```c
if (pid > 0) {
    // Parent process
    wait(&status);  // Parent waits for the child to terminate
    printf("Parent Process: Child has exited with status %d\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
}
```

- The parent process waits for the child process to terminate.
- Once the child exits, the parent retrieves the exit status of the child using `WEXITSTATUS(status)` and prints it.

---

## Key Concepts

- **`fork()`**: Used to create a child process. The parent gets the child’s PID, while the child gets `0`.
- **`exit()`**: Used by the child process to terminate. The exit status can be retrieved by the parent process using `wait()`.
- **`wait()`**: Makes the parent process wait for the child to finish and allows it to retrieve the child’s exit status.

---

## Summary

This program demonstrates how the `exit()` system call is used in the child process to terminate, while the parent uses the `wait()` system call to wait for the child process to finish. The parent retrieves the child’s exit status after it terminates.

| System Call | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `fork()`    | Creates a child process. |
| `exit()`    | Terminates the calling process. |
| `wait()`    | Makes the parent process wait for the child process to terminate. |
